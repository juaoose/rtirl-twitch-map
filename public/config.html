    Welcome! This extension requires no further configuration in Twitch besides selecting in which component you want it
    to be displayed.
    However, this extension will not work unless you sign up to the <a href="https://rtirl.com/"
      target="_blank">RealtimeIRL website</a>
    using your Twitch account and
    then push your location using the RealtimeIRL mobile application.
