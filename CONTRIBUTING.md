# Contribution Guidelines

Every contribution is welcome! But please:

- Use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to make creating changelogs easier, this is important because Twitch requests a changelog for version changes.
- Make sure you follow the [Twitch Extensions Documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions).

You could also contact us through the [Realtime Discord](https://discord.gg/UKHJMQs74u).
